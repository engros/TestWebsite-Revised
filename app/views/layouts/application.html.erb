<!--
weâ€™ve replaced the HTML shim stylesheet lines with a single call to a Rails helper called render.
The effect of this line is to look for a file called app/views/layouts/_shim.html.erb, evaluate its contents, and insert the results into the view.-->

<!--Note the leading underscore on the filename _shim.html.erb; this underscore is the universal convention for naming partials, and among other things makes it possible to identify all the partials in a directory at a glance.-->
