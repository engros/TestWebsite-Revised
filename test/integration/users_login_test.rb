Visit the login path.
Verify that the new sessions form renders properly.
Post to the sessions path with an invalid params hash.
Verify that the new sessions form gets re-rendered
and that a flash message appears.
Visit another page (such as the Home page).
Verify that the flash message doesnâ€™t appear on the new page.
